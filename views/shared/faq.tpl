            <div class="faq-question">What is the difference between double and triple glazing?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p><strong>Double glazing</strong> features two glass panels with a sealed gas-filled space between them, available in 60mm, 70mm, and 80mm profiles. It offers good insulation at a more affordable price.</p>
                <p><strong>Triple glazing</strong> features three glass panels creating two insulating chambers, available in 71mm and 81mm profiles. It provides superior thermal and acoustic insulation, ideal for energy-efficient buildings and extreme weather locations.</p>
                <p>Both options are energy efficient, but triple glazing offers better protection against heat loss and external noise with higher long-term energy savings.</p>
